## The Basics

---

### What stats affect Minions on the tree?

On the tree itself only the **nodes** that are labeled `minions  ` will effect minions. Period. There are special cases like SRS and Summon Skeletons where grabbing increased duration nodes will make them last longer since they are labeled with the "duration" tag.

---

### How does support gems interact with minions?

When it comes to support gem linking you will need to **observe what that minion does**. 

For example a zombie can be considered a melee toon who uses default attacks. Using a Multistrike gem will make him attack 3 times in quick succession. Using added fire gem will give him extra damage as fire. 

Raise Spectre is where things get more interesting. Take the flame sentinel for example. Upon observing its characteristic you come to realize that these guys has fork and lmp already "linked" to them. You then can surmise that any support links that work on the fireball skill gem will work on flame sentinels.

###  How do I create Corpses?

Use the **desecrate gem** and it will summon corpses of the base type of monsters u find in that zone. Keep in mind a level 19+ Desecrate gem will allow you to create monsters of the highest base level for the zone you are in.

### How do I target Corpses?

The default key is "A", you can change this in the hotkey settings. Hover over the corspe hold A, then u can raise spectre

---

### How do I turn on minion life bars?

Go to options -> Ui -> Allies health bar

---

### How do I heal my minions?

• You can roll "of animation" on your life flasks for 40-60% effect provided to them. This can be buffed by flask or life flask effectiveness stat
• Using the Convocation Gem gives them a small heal over time
• Using a Rejuvenation Totem
• Any instance of heal on block
• Minion life regen
• Minion Life leach and leach support gem
• Severed in Sleep gain 20% maximum life on killing a poisoned enemy
• Vitality Aura
• If you are running the Immortalis Belt you can use any flasks that heals for zombies and spectres

---

### Minion ToolTip

For the most part the tooltip is **WRONG**. The Life values might be right but the dps values are definitely wrong. We can't rely on the tool tip to see how much damage our minions are doing you will need to calculate that manually unfortunately.

---

### Does Stats like Dex, Int, and Str affect minions?

Minions do not have Base attributes. They can gain stats from necro aegis and uniques such as the baron unique helmet. Minions do gain the same stat scaling player does

---

### What are minions Resistances?

By Default most minions(AW, srs, skele, zombros, anything summoned like spectral wolves) now have 40% ele res and 20% chaos resistances . Spectre's will have +30% naturally giving them 70% all res. Golems have 70% by default from their respective elements while chaos/stone will have 40%.

This means with the necromancer ascendancy that give +20% all res and the 16% you get from the tree will cap any kind of minion to 75%(they all get 76%). You can run purity to cap in situations where they get cursed it also makes it a lot easier to overcap with the tri purity auras for all minions.
What this means is minions in general are much tankier now in all situations.

**Relevant patch notes:**
• Raise Spectre now grants +30% elemental resistances to its minions.
• Fire, Cold, and Lightning Golems now have 70% resistance to their respective element. Chaos Golems now have 60% resistance to Chaos.
• Totems and all other minions now have 40% elemental resistance and 20% chaos resistance. This also includes minions that didn't have resistances previously, like wolves

### Can Minions Crit?

Most minions will have a base crit chance of 5% with a 130% crit multiplier. Certain monsters raised with raise spectre may have more then the base.

## Passive Nodes

### Minion Instability

Low life means when minions fall below 35% life. With this node they will explode for 33% of their maximum life as fire damage. And yes this damage is boosted by your minion damage stat and related support gems linked to said minion who blew up. The general consensuses by most veteran summoners and myself included is that this is a terrible keystone. You effectively cut your minion life pool by 35% with a small explosion in return. Your minions will do way more damage alive. However you can build a niche spec around this notable.

### Necromantic Aegis

This makes it so ALL of your shield stats. Yes, every stat listed. Will affect your minions and your own character will no longer gain those stats. They will also gain the unique mechanics from the shields as well. A good example is the Victario's Charity it will grant minions the ability to generate their own charges something they cannot do by default.

---

### Conduit

<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/59f6a4fea7af072b183bd679188e9df9.png" height="300"/>

Minions count as "allies" This is a very important key term. "Allies" are NOT "Party members" this means anything that says it effects party members will not effect allies. So conduit does not work. You will need to supply charges in other ways, for example warlords mark, assassin mark, poacher's mark, Frenzy Gorilla spectre, and Victario's Charity on Necromantic Aegis.

---

### Elemental Equilibrium

You see this keystone picked up a lot in Summoner builds. Normally referred to as "EE" any elemental damage type your character deals will +25% that element and -50% the resistances of the other two elements. Your minions will not trigger EE themselves which makes it a free dmg boost for elemental dmg minions.
